# Rules for NEO Creative Design Competition

## Background

NEO, a world renowned blockchain project, has been on the fast track of development in recent years, making considerable breakthroughs in development and community expansion. Given that the community has placed high expectation on our branding and promotional effect, we are planning on a creative design competition – NEO Creative Design Competition to put heads together with the purpose of diversifying the visual elements and enhancing the visual effect of our brand. By holding the competition, we also hope to find more talented designers willing to join NEO community to contribute.

## Theme

Revolving around the theme “Smart Economy”, NEO Creative Design Competition will include two tracks of competition: NEO website design and NEO icon design.

#### [NEO Website design]

NEO website plays an essential role of branding and information display and is deemed as the main source of information by our followers. Whether the design fits aesthetical standard and whether it follows interactive and operational logics leave an immediate impression on the visitors. To adapt our website to the expectations of users in the project’s fast growing period, we are now collecting NEO website designs.

An ideal design should be aesthetically pleasing, accommodating both the designing elements and the technology concept of NEO. The design is required to follow interactive logics and our community operations model.

#### 【NEO Icon Design】

The design should demonstrate the features and roles of each concept, fits in harmony with the overall visual style of NEO and also reflects the design philosophy of NEO. Competitors are required to choose at least 5 out of the 10 concepts given below. See detailed descriptions of each concept (here).
