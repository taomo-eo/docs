## Background

NEO, a world renowned blockchain project, has made fast progress in recent years with considerable breakthroughs in development and the explosive growth of its global community.

## Theme

The NEO Creative Design Competition will include two tracks of competition: NEO website design and NEO icon design. Participants are encouraged to keep NEO’s theme of a “Smart Economy” at the heart of their design.

#### [NEO Website design]

The NEO website plays an essential role in NEO’s brand, with the design aesthetic and user experience leaving an immediate impression on visitors. It is also an important communication tool and a primary source of information for people who are interested in the project. In an effort to ensure our website meets the expectations of the community, we are inviting designers to submit new designs for the NEO website.

Designs should aim to be aesthetically pleasing, whilst using the design elements to communicate the technological concepts of NEO. Designs should be in line with the principle of good user interaction experience as well as the feature of a community-driven project.

#### [NEO Icon Design]

NEO is an original public chain project. Many of its concepts are original and self-defined, representing essential parts of the ecosystem. To explain and promote understanding of these concepts, we are inviting designers to submit icons for each.

The icon designs should contain unique elements that tie into the features and roles of each concept, whilst harmonizing with NEO’s overall visual identity. Competitors are required to choose at least 5 out of the 10 concepts given below.
