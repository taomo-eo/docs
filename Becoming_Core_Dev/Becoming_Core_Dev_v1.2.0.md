NEO operates as an open-source project. Developers who are interested in contributing to core NEO projects are welcomed and encouraged. Anyone can make contributions, ranging from GitHub issues, documentations to providing new features and patches. Those who have given consistent, high quality contributions to development will be consiered for being a Core Develoer. 

## Criteria

### Projects to Contribute

#### 1) GitHub Repositories

For GitHub repositories, please fork, fix, commit and send a Pull Request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. A more detailed guideline can be found on the contribution section for the NEO core project [here](https://github.com/neo-project/neo#how-to-contribute). 

*Each individual project may also have their own guidelines to code formatting and pull requests, consult them when applicable.*

### Qualifying as a Core Developer

In general, a contributer will be considered for the role of a core developer when he/she has: 

- Been able to consistenly make pull requests that do not require extensive reviews and re-writes. 
- Over the last 3 months, made over 5 pull requests that have been committed to the project OR have edited(added and deleted) over 200 lines of code [*(number determined by referencing /neo-project commits)*](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/graphs/contributors). 

> *Please note that these criteria are not hard and fast rules for qualifying as a core developer, but only a reference of the work expected from one. The actual criteria will vary for each project and each developer. Developers who would like to be considered for a core developer are advised to get in touch with the existing maintainers and core developers through email, Github and [Discord](https://discord.io/neo)*



## Access

Once someone gains the core developer status, they will be sent an email to become the `collaborator` on the respective project on GitHub. This means they are granted `commit` privileges to the repositories of the neo project. 



## Responsibilities 

A core developer is: 

- Responsible for handling the consequences of accepting/committing a change into the code base. This mostly includes reverting or fixing the commit if it causes any problems for the project. 
- Responsible for for tracking the `issues` tab of the project they are contributing to. The core developer should reply to issues when they are able to, and decide when issues listed or changes proposed should be escalated for wider discussion among core developers. 



## Incentivization

A core developer receives monetary rewards from NEO Foundation. Core developers who make continued contributions in the future will be granted core developer rewards continuously. 

*However, it is worth noting that community contributors who become 'core developers' do not become employees of NEO. The goal is to encourage and cultivate the interest in learning about and contributing to NEO's development.*
